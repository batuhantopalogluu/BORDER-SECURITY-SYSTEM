# BORDER-SECURITY-SYSTEM
 Gebze Technical University  - CSE - Graduation Project
 
 - The purpose of this project is to monitor terrestrial borders autonomously with sensors and subsystems.
 
	- Within the scope of the project, 4 different devices were designed. These devices communicate with each other with Wifi over the mesh     network.
	
	- All Nodes has ESP32 mcu Wifi module for connect to network. 
	
	 Devices:
		
	 1 - Rooter Node :  
						
					 This is device connected to the managament center's network and it acts as a bridge between the sensors and the             		          managament center. In addition, the device has a camera module and a gyroscope sensor to fix the camera angle.
		
		   Hardware components:
					
					> Esp32 Cam Wifi module and camera.
					> Mpu6050 gyroscope sensor.
					> LM2596 voltaj reducer.
					> 18650 battery bed.
					> 2 x 18650 battery.
					
		
		2 - Geophone Node :
					
					.... (will be added)
					
					Hardware components:
					
					> Esp32 Wifi module.
					> 3 x Oyo Geospace geophone
					> LM2596 voltaj reducer.
					> 18650 battery bed.
					> 2 x 18650 battery.
					
		3 - Motion Sensor Node :
		
						.... (will be added)
						
						Hardware components:
					
					> Esp32 Wifi module.
					> 180* motion sensor.
					> LM2596 voltaj reducer.
					> 18650 battery bed.
					> 2 x 18650 battery.
					
	 4 - ? Node :  .... (will be added)
